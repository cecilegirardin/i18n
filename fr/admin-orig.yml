          - **Attendee** fields: are used to collect information _specific to a person_ and will be asked for _each attendee_ on a booking.
          - **Booking** fields: will only be requested _once per booking_ so shouldn't be specific to an individual person.
          
          The fields with type **Attendee email** and **Full name** fields are special _attendee only_ fields and will be used to identify the attendee.
          
          Fields are setup here for the whole account and are not ordered. The fields are then selected and ordered on each specific entry.

          #### Setting up discounts
          
          Discounts are applied to the total cost of a booking calculated on the tickets or booking types selected.
          
          To setup a discount, create a new **Discount set** and then assign which tickets it applies to and what discounts apply.
          
          **Discount codes** and **Discount rules** can be assigned to the set and given a fixed amount or a percentage off.
          
          Sets and codes _can be deleted_ without affecting bookings. The bookings will still show what code or rule was used.
