Language files for [bookwhen.com](https://bookwhen.com) - the booking system for classes, courses, workshops and events.

### Translation files

The files are in a `yaml` format so should be edited in a text editor, and the whitespace should be preserved.

 - Only translate the parts in quotes.
 - All values must be kept in the same order with the same indentation and gaps.
 - Parts of text looking like this %{code} must not be changed as they are used
   for merging. They may be repositioned to make the sentence structure correct.
 - Things like &copy; are HTML codes that translate to symbols on the page.
 - \n is a code for a new line.
 - Text surrounded by ** becomes bold (but not everywhere).
 - URLs (links) should be kept the same.
